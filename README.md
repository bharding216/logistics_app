# Logistics App

The purpose of this application is to track and manage the shipment of bulk chemicals. 

Components:
Bootstrap framework (CSS) and HTML on the front end 
Flask (Python) for the back end
MySQL for the database. 

There are also some bells and whistles that I implemented using Javascript.
